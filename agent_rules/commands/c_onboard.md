## Project Description

@tool@ Read `./agent_rules/project_description.md`
@if (the file does not exist, is empty, or only contains the placeholder "TODO: Describe your project here")@
  @tool@ Warn the user: "No project description found. Please update `agent_rules/project_description.md` with a brief description of what this project is and what it does. This helps agents understand the project quickly during onboarding."
@else@
  @tool@ Present the project description to the user

## Check Branch and Sync Status

@tool@ Run `git fetch && git branch --show-current && git status` @into@ --git_output

@if (current branch != "dev" AND current branch does not start with "dev-")@
  @tool@ Warn the user: "You are on branch '{current branch}', which is not `dev` or a `dev-*` feature branch. Be aware that dev work typically happens on `dev`."
@end if@

@if (--git_output contains "behind")@
  @stop@ Your branch is behind the remote — there are changes we don't have locally. This must be resolved before we continue.

  Ask the user: "Your branch is behind the remote. I'll pull the latest changes now. Shall I proceed?"

  @if (user confirms)@
    @if (--git_output shows uncommitted changes — staged, unstaged, or untracked files)@
      @tool@ Run `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: save local changes before rebase"`
    @end if@

    @tool@ Run `git pull --rebase origin {current branch}`
    @if (pull/rebase failed due to conflicts)@
      Assist the user in resolving the conflicts. The remote takes precedence, but do NOT discard local work — merge it in where possible. Walk through each conflict with the user, then run `git rebase --continue` once resolved.
    @end if@
  @end if@
@end if@
